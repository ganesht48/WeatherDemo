	•	Implemented design patterns such as Singleton and Factory.
	•	Followed the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

	•	Add Unit Tests and UI Tests by using mocked classes (e.g., MockedWeatherService).
	•	Implement a localization service to manage app strings.
	•	Utilize snapshot testing and Gherkin-based tests for UI/UX validation.
	•	Integrate SwiftLint and SwiftFormat for enforcing cleaner and consistent code styles.
